    <h1>Injera (Ethiopian Teff Bread)</h1>
    <img src="../images/teff-bread.jpg" alt="teff-bread" style="width: 20%;">
    <p>
        A naturally fermented, spongy, gluten-free flatbread from Ethiopia is made from teff flour and water, using wild
        yeast to ferment over a couple of days. It is then cooked like a crepe and turned into a flavorful, tangy bread
        to
        serve with your favorite Ethiopian food. The fermentation process can take up to 2 or 3 days, depending on your
        climate. Injera is typically served with vegetables and/or meat on top where the bread is actually an eating
        utensil.

    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup white teff flour</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/ <sub>4</sub> brown teff flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white teff flour, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Directions</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Mix 1/2 cup white teff flour and brown teff flour together in a bowl. Add 1 cup water and whisk well. Pour
            mixture into a glass container large enough to hold 3 times the original volume. Cover with cheesecloth or
            other breathable fabric to keep out dust; do not seal with plastic wrap as air circulation is vital. Leave
            covered container in a draft-free environment; the mixture needs air to be circulated in order to ferment.
            Stir batter 2 times over 24 hours.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Check for bubbles and possibly an increase in volume after 24 hours; there may also be a slightly tangy and
            sour smell. When you notice these things, add 1 tablespoon white teff flour and 1 tablespoon water to the
            batter and whisk well. Check in a few hours to see if bubbles have again formed, mixture has increased in
            volume, and the pungent smell is still evident; if so, the batter is ready and you can skip to the cooking
            process (step 5).</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Leave batter to rest another 12 hours if the mixture has not begun to form or smell sour after the first 24
            hours; stir once during this time. Check to see if bubbles have formed, mixture has increased in volume, and
            a pungent smell is evident; if so, proceed with step 4.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Mix together 2 tablespoons white teff flour and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl, making sure there are no
            lumps. Add mixture to the batter, whisking well. Wait a few hours; batter should be bubbly with a noticeable
            increase in volume and a pungent but fragrant smell, indicating it is ready to be cooked.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Heat an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add oil. Pour a scant 1/2 cup batter slowly
            and steadily into the hot pan in a circular motion from outside to inside. Cover the pan completely in a
            spiral without swirling. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, allowing steam to cook the top of the
            bread, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from pan with spatula and transfer to a plate; cover to keep warm. Repeat with
            remaining batter.</p>
    </ol>
